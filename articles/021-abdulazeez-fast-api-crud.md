## Personal Connection

I respect Azeez so much, not just because he wrote one of the best intro books on FastAPI ("Building Python Web APIs with FastAPI"), but also because of how well he's positioned himself as a FastAPI expert. He's been preaching about the framework since 2020 (FastAPI came out in 2018).

I'm an AI engineer and I use FastAPI for all my web API needs - it's the standard in our ecosystem today. Just like everyone in this collection, I've been following Azeez for a while. He's very strong on contributing to the community through OSS, mentorship, tutorials and engagement.

While he has many FastAPI tutorials, I picked this one because it's foundational and still very relevant for anyone getting started with this web framework.

## Key Insights

> "By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to: Develop a RESTful API with Python and FastAPI, Interact with MongoDB asynchronously, Run MongoDB in the cloud with MongoDB Atlas, Deploy a FastAPI app to Heroku."

This comprehensive tutorial covers the complete journey from development to deployment. Azeez walks through building a student management system with full CRUD operations, using Motor for asynchronous MongoDB interactions, and deploying to Heroku with MongoDB Atlas. The tutorial includes Pydantic schemas for data validation, proper project structure, and real-world deployment considerations.

## Impact & Relevance

This tutorial has become a go-to resource for developers learning FastAPI with MongoDB. Azeez's expertise in FastAPI shines through the clean code structure and best practices demonstrated throughout. The combination of FastAPI's modern Python features with MongoDB's flexibility makes this a practical foundation for building production APIs.

For developers entering the FastAPI ecosystem, this tutorial provides a solid foundation that covers both development fundamentals and deployment considerations, making it an essential learning resource that remains relevant today.
