## Personal Connection

I was earning $5 per technical how-to tutorial from a certain demographic I won't mention. I was completely unaware of the income potential of technical writing. Then I started following Linda Ikechukwu. She was so open about how she made income from technical writing. I worked for her for a while - she was so nice and cool. Seeing her work with different agencies and take her work so seriously inspired me.

But late last year, I realized I didn't have a portfolio or knew how to package one for technical writing. Who else to turn to but Linda?

## Key Insights

> "Don't just present a list of links. For each sample, tell the behind-the-scenes story. What challenges did you face? What skills did you employ?"

Her guide "How to create a Technical Writing Portfolio" on everythingtechnicalwritingdotcom became my reference. She built the site from her own experience. The site gets 4,000+ monthly visitors and ranks first page on Google for "technical writing portfolio."

## Impact & Relevance

Just like everyone in this series so far, this is another ageless resource. Her insight about storytelling behind each portfolio piece fundamentally changed how I present my work.
