## Personal Connection

Edidiong is a close friend of mine but before we became friends, I've been following her journey for a while right from HNG 1 days. She has one of the most impressive resumes and is a global thought leader in open source globally. She speaks at so many international tech events and is a notable OSCA team member.

I haven't told her this but she's one of my references when it comes to utilizing the power of storytelling to deliver value in technical writing. This article was the first I read from her and you can see that.

## Key Insights

> "Contributing to Open Source organizations opens you up to a lot of opportunities and connects you with people doing amazing things all over the world. Yes, I was rejected a couple of times, but if you look at it on the bright side, those losses made me stand a greater chance at the next opportunity."

This article demonstrates the power of perseverance through rejection and how open source contributions create unexpected opportunities. Edidiong's journey from multiple failed applications to landing at Interswitch and eventually Google Season of Docs shows that consistent effort pays off.

## Impact & Relevance

What makes this article exceptional is how Edidiong uses her personal story of failures and eventual success to encourage others. The detailed narrative of her rejections from GSOC and Outreachy, followed by how those contributions still led to job opportunities, has inspired countless Nigerian developers to start contributing to open source. Her storytelling approach makes complex career advice relatable and actionable.

Currently she's a developer advocate at MongoDB.
