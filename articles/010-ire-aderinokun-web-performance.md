## Personal Connection

Ire Aderinokun is a legend in the global web dev community. She was also the first Nigerian woman to become a Google Developer Expert in web technologies.

## Key Insights

> "In a web.dev article on 'User-centric Performance Metrics', they frame performance metrics around four questions: Is it happening? Is it useful? Is it usable? Is it delightful?"

Web performance is and will always be a major topic for every generation of developer building for the web. Ire Aderinokun is a thought leader in this space and you can see that in how clearly she explains complex performance concepts.

## Impact & Relevance

What I specifically love about this cheatsheet is that it transforms web performance from complex theory into actionable targets. Instead of wondering what metrics matter, you get specific numbers for every major performance indicator organized around those four practical questions. This comprehensive resource consolidates everything from TTFB to Core Web Vitals into an invaluable reference for modern web optimization.
