## Personal Connection

Chris believes in the power of storytelling. Here's my story about this article. Back in 2018, I was a 16-year-old programmer, doing it for fun. I didn't even know you could make money through "this thing." Then I saw Chris mentioned in Prosper Otemuyiwa's DevFest South-South 2018 talk, and that was my turning point. The strides he was making in technical writing while being a developer and community driver were outstanding.

## Key Insights

> "We are fighting just the police for mistaking techies and related careers as fraudsters when we have a much bigger problem."

In 2018, when Chris was repeatedly denied visas to speak at international conferences, he could have given up. Instead, he turned frustration into action. That viral thread didn't just express pain - it sparked solutions. Chris co-created the Concatenate Conference, bringing international speakers to Lagos instead of waiting for doors to open elsewhere.

## Impact & Relevance

Do you know what's crazy? 7 years later and we still suffer from everything Christian mentioned in this thread. In fact, Abdulfatai Suleiman of Blockradar just had similar issues recently. He wasn't able to make it to Switzerland in time to join his team at the CVConf pitch competition. Blockradar won despite that! This is why I got inspired to share these articles and stories from Nigerian developers! Since then, we have more Nigerian developers speaking at international events. This is why I encourage everyone to write and share their stories. Even the vulnerable ones. You don't know who is out there listening and benefiting from your bravery.
