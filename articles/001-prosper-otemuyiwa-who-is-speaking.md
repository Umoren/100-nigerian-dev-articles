## Personal Connection

When Prosper posted this article in 2020, it was so inspiring and I was like "I will be like this guy one day". 5 years later I'm re-reading it again and I can attribute this mental model as the biggest influencer to how I think about career advancement.

## Key Insights

> "I realized that being smart and working hard was not enough. It still wasn't getting me at the top of the class... when your name is called, if no one else in that room can speak on your behalf, they just go to the next name."

Prosper breaks down why technical skills alone aren't enoughâ€”you need advocates. The PayPal Mafia example he shares shows how powerful networks compound over time. This piece perfectly illustrates why relationships ARE assets.

## Impact & Relevance

This article fundamentally changed how I think about career advancement - from focusing purely on technical skills to understanding the importance of building genuine relationships and having people who can advocate for you when opportunities arise.
