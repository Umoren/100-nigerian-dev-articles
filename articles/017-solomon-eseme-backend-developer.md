## Personal Connection

When it comes to Solomon, you can't really pick just one article. He's a technical writing resource himself who has built a strong brand in technical authorship and backend development expertise. Following his work got me inspired to apply for community writing programs (Strapi, Sanity, LogRocket) in 2022. The way he pushes his SaaS product Mastering Backend introduced me to building indie dev projects while unemployed.

Solomon deserves his flowers. He has done so much for the developer ecosystem without being loud about it.

## Key Insights
