## Personal Connection

2 years ago, I woke up to see this article, and it was buzzing among engineers in the ecosystem. I've been following Shalvah for a while on X, and I always look forward to his engineering insights. BTW, this is the same developer who built Twitter bots used by over a million people, and ran them for less than $100/month. He also maintains Scribe.

## Key Insights

> "When your deployments take forever, productivity dies a slow death."

What I love about this article is that it's not theoretical. It's real engineering solving real problems with measurable impact.

## Impact & Relevance

Article 2/100 from developers who prove that Nigerians don't just use technology - we optimize it. This article gained significant traction in the Nigerian engineering community because it addressed a universal pain point with concrete, measurable solutions.
