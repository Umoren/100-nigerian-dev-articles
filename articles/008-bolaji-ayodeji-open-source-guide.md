## Personal Connection

I met Bolaji Ayodeji at GDG Devfest Uyo in 2019. He taught a session on "Fixed vs Growth Mindset" that has lived with me till today.

## Key Insights

> "Open Source is a flourishing and beneficial ecosystem that publicly solves problems in communities and industries using software through a decentralized model and community contributions."

When he published "Contributing to Open Source Pocket Guide" in 2022, it became our reference manual. Many of us used it while applying for GSoC, GSoD, LFX, Outreachy, and contributor writing programs. What made this guide special was how it expanded contribution beyond code - 12 different ways from design to community management. It showed us that everyone has something to offer in open source.

## Impact & Relevance

With Open Source Community Africa OSCAFest 2025 coming up, this article is relevant again. I'm personally going back to finding ways I can contribute to OSS because I believe it's the best option for newbies and struggling engineers like myself. Bolaji has always been consistent with open-source work. This guide introduced a generation of Nigerian developers to meaningful OSS contribution. Also, with AI in its early stages, I think this is a great opportunity to be an active open-source contributor.
