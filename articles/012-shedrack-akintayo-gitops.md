## Personal Connection

Shedrack is a terrific person. He has the growth mindset for sure. I've seen him transition from frontend developer to technical writer to developer relations to a Cloud Native DevOps Engineer. The guy is just incredible and exemplifies "lock in".

## Key Insights

> "The main reason why you should care about GitOps is how much improvement it brings to the overall customer experience. GitOps can accelerate the way you ship new features, bug fixes, and improvements to your product to customers with the entire git-based approach and automated deployment capabilities."

I picked this article on GitOps because even while it was a guest post for Ambassador Labs, he explained GitOps in a very clear manner that it had business value to developers. GitOps is very relevant especially for new-age AI engineers like myself trying to deploy production systems.

## Impact & Relevance

This article bridges the gap between complex DevOps concepts and practical developer needs. Shedrack's clear explanation of GitOps versus IaC, along with actionable adoption steps, makes this an evergreen resource for developers moving into cloud-native deployments. The business-focused approach helps developers understand not just the "how" but the "why" behind GitOps adoption.

Except from engineering, Shedrack is a community leader. He has given a lot of talks internationally and locally, helps a lot of developers with his resources and a really chill guy to follow. He's currently building https://pullbase.io/.
