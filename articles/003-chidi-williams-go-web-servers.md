## Personal Connection

I've been following him for a while, and he has one of the best engineering minds that I appreciate so much. You can see that from his writing. This article came out 5 years ago when the conversation around getting into Go was serenading discussions in our ecosystem (developer events and Twitter conversations). So it had an impact!

## Key Insights

> "Clean architecture is a design pattern for separating concerns... presents this architecture as a way of breaking up an application into loosely-coupled components. The architecture divides the application into four main components: entities, use cases, interface adapters, and frameworks & drivers."

What I love about this piece is the clarity and how technically in-depth it is. The way he breaks down complex architectural concepts into digestible insights is exactly why he's such a respected voice in our community.

## Author Background

Co-founder and CTO of Rulebase (YC F24), known for his expertise in clean architecture and Go development.

## Impact & Relevance

This article provided clarity during a crucial period when Nigerian developers were evaluating Go as a backend language. It's still a great resource to share with new developers and technical writers going into Go. The architectural principles remain timeless.
