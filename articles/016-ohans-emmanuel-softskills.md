## Personal Connection

Ohans Emmanuel is a published author of 5+ books, software engineer, and one of the most published technical authors in the ecosystem. This piece tackles something most developers struggle with - how to get better at soft skills beyond just reading about them.

## Key Insights

> "You should look for opportunities throughout your typical day in which you can convert your normal developer/company activities into activities for deliberate practice. What if you could master soft skills while going about your regular day to day work?"

The genius here is showing developers how to practice soft skills during code reviews, stand-ups, and team presentations instead of treating it as separate "extra work." Ohans breaks down Anders Ericsson's deliberate practice principles and makes them practical for busy developers who want to level up their communication, public speaking, and teamwork skills.

## Impact & Relevance

This approach beats the traditional method of reading endless self-help books without actual practice. By converting everyday work activities into deliberate practice opportunities, developers can master soft skills while still getting their regular work done. The article provides a clear framework that remains as relevant today as when it was written.

Six years later, this practical approach still outperforms theoretical learning when it comes to actually developing soft skills that matter in tech careers.
