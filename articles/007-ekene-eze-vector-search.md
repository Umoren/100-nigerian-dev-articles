## Personal Connection

This article is how I got serious about building AI applications. Ekene Eze will feature a lot in this series! Most developers/technical writers/developer advocates in the ecosystem know him through his work, and he's found a way to stay relevant forever. But just like everyone in this series so far, I've been following his work since 2018.

## Key Insights

> "Vector embeddings allow developers to offer contextually relevant search results instead of exact keyword matches."

This tutorial on "Implementing vector search with OpenAI, Next.js, and Supabase" on LogRocket was very timely because the vector DB education wasn't as accessible as it is today. For a demo, he built a celebrity search application using Next.js, Supabase vector database, and OpenAI embeddings. When you search "space entrepreneur," the app returns Elon Musk even though those exact words aren't in his profile.

## Impact & Relevance

I also loved this cause it shows the complete implementation - from generating embeddings to storing vectors in Supabase to building the search API. This helped me understand how vector search works in real applications. BTW, Ekene Eze is also the founder of DXMentorship. One thing I've learned from Ekene is that he'll go the extra mile to teach.
