## Personal Connection

Gift is one of the major people who inspired me to take technical writing as a developer seriously. She doesn't just brand herself for social media hype - she does it developer-first style.

## Key Insights

> "I wasn't convinced at first. Utility-first CSS seemed like inline styles with extra steps. But after building a few components, I started seeing the benefits: faster development, consistent design systems, and maintainable code."

It's no surprise, then, that in 2019, she wrote one of the most impactful articles introducing Tailwind CSS. Today, TailwindCSS is THE CSS framework. Then, it was Bootstrap's world. See the authenticity in her voice? She's a technical thought leader without announcing it.

## Impact & Relevance

This article on Tailwind wasn't just writing about a new tool - she was seeing the future of CSS architecture. She was also a major evangelist in the JAMstack era when that was still emerging. A very impactful name in the global JS community. She deserves her flowers!
