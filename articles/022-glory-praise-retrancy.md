## Personal Connection

Glory has been my friend since university days in 2019. Before the term "locked in" became a thing, she's always been in that headspace. High agency, committed to service and leadership, very active community engagement, very resilient and hardworking. I've seen her move from frontend dev → technical writing → blockchain → developer advocate/content creation and she's always just done things and done them significantly.

She does lots of mentoring at Web3Bridge since graduating in 2022, taking responsibility for helping others get what she has. Her YouTube channel recently crossed 2.45k subscribers and 99 videos! One thing I like about her is that she didn't go into blockchain just for the money when it was booming, but because she really believed in the technology itself. That's why she'll always be relevant in this space.

## Key Insights

> "Reentrancy is a form of vulnerability that can happen in Solidity contracts when an external contract has the ability to call the main smart contract function repeatedly in order to drain its funds before the original call has ended."

Glory breaks down one of the most devastating smart contract vulnerabilities, referencing famous attacks like The DAO hack that lost millions of dollars. She provides both vulnerable and secure code examples, demonstrating the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, ReentrancyGuard implementation, and mutex patterns to prevent these attacks.

## Impact & Relevance

This article teaches developers how to identify, understand, and prevent one of the most critical security flaws in smart contracts. Just like the rest in this series, it's an ageless resource that addresses fundamental blockchain security concerns. The vulnerability patterns Glory explains will remain relevant as long as smart contracts exist, making this essential reading for any Solidity developer.

Her practical approach to security education, combined with real-world examples and multiple mitigation strategies, provides developers with the knowledge needed to build secure decentralized applications.
