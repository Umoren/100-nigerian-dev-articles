## Personal Connection

Today I wasn't feeling inspired to do anything. So I decided to just read articles from my bookmarks, and I found this piece by Obinna Odirionye about "How to become an engineer," and it inspired me to make this post.

## Key Insights

> "I made a tool called Stacks... You don't have to copy and paste commands from tons of blog posts anymore."

> "After 80+ rejections, I finally got a YES!"

In 2019, he locked in really hard and built three viral open-source tools. Stacks trended on GitHub. I also want to add, there's nothing better than working with high agency, ambitious people like Obinna described. Iron sharpeneth iron. Also, faith without works is dead!

## Impact & Relevance

Today, he's a CNCF Ambassador and founder of Clouddley. Building in public works. This article serves as inspiration for developers facing rejection and building persistence in the ecosystem.
